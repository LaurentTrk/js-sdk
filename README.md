# PhaPass, a password manager on Phala

:warning: **Work In Progress.** As a Hackathon project, it is not ready for production use. Use it at your own risks :)

A project for the [Advanced Phala Challenge](https://github.com/Phala-Network/Encode-Hackathon-2021/blob/master/advanced-challenge.md) of the [Encode Polkadot Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/polkadot-club-hackathon).

It tries to demonstrate how we could rely on the Phala Confidential Contract feature to keep track of passwords.

This repository holds the PhaPass [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/) code, which connects the PhaPass Blockchain to the user browser.
See [this package](./packages/phapass-extension).

The Blockchain part code of this project can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/LaurentTrk/phapass).
